## Introduction  
MovieMash is a movie rating alternative to the common 'X out of 10' or '5 star' systems found on places like [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) or [Letterboxd](https://www.letterboxd.com). Inspired by the infamous [FaceMash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook#FaceMash), this project aims to use a similar system to rate and rank a far more pleasant[[SYNONYM]] subject[[SYNONYM]]. It also aims to, given enough data from users, allow analysis of the merits of this rating system compared to others.
